# **Java Battleship**

## Synopsis
This is a game of Battleship, it is a two player game where the first player picks the number of ships
and places them in a grid. after which the second player tries to sink the ships.

## Motivation
This is a program for the Introduction to programming class final project. I created it for my final project in that class.

## How to Play
The game is played by the first player (the player owning the ships) picks the number of ships
and places them in a 5x5 grid, choosing first an "x" axis and then a "y" axis.(0-4 respectively)

The second player will choose the placement of the bombs or mines to try and sink the ships.
they have 5 more bombs than ships placed to try and sink player ones ships.

## Code Example
here is a code example of player one placing thier ships.
```
System.out.println("Enter number of ships to place: ");
		int ship = input.nextInt();
		int hit = 1;
		int miss = 0;
		for (int px = 0; px < ship; px++) {
			System.out.print("Enter a row (0,thru 4) for Ship Location: ");
			int xr = input.nextInt();
			while(xr > 4 || xr < 0){
				System.out.print("Enter a row (0,thru 4) for Ship Location: ");
				xr = input.nextInt();
			}
			System.out.print("Enter a column (0,thru 4) for Ship Location: ");
			int xc = input.nextInt();
			while(xc > 4 || xc < 0){
				System.out.print("Enter a row (0,thru 4) Ship Location: ");
				xc = input.nextInt();
			}
				if (ogame[xr][xc] == " "){
					ogame[xr][xc] = "O";
				}
				else if (ogame[xr][xc] == "O"){
					System.out.println("\nShip already in this place!");
					px++;
					
				}
				
		}
		System.out.println("\n "+ ship + " Ships PLaced, X's Turn!");
		System.out.println("\nX you only have " + (ship + 5) + " Bombs!");
		System.out.println("\nGood Luck!");
```

## Tests
there are no value returning methods.
